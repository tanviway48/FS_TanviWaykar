# 🎓 Student Commute Optimizer (MERN Stack)

A privacy-first carpooling and route-sharing application for students.  
Instead of commuting individually, students can **find route matches**, **share rides**, and **chat anonymously**.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Students traveling similar routes commute separately, leading to:
- Wasted time ⏳  
- Increased costs 💸  
- Higher traffic & pollution 🌍  

The app aims to match students with similar routes for efficient carpooling.

---

## 💡 Solution Approach

- Students enter **origin, destination, and travel time**.  
- Backend finds **matching trips** using geospatial proximity and time windows.  
- Users remain **anonymous with unique usernames**.  
- Built-in **real-time chat** for matched users.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **MongoDB** – Store users, trips, messages  
- **Express.js** – Backend REST API  
- **Node.js** – Server runtime  
- **React (Vite)** – Frontend interface
